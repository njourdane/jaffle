## Introduction

Jaffle is a yaml-based syntax for [Tidal-cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), based on [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org).

It aims to make algorithmic music more accessible for people who are not familiar with programming languages.

Under the hood, Jaffle is a transpiler generating JavaScript code, which is then interpreted by Strudel.

## Features

- easy to read syntax (albeit more verbose than Strudel);
- use lambda functions, expressions, variable definitions, [and more](https://roipoussiere.frama.io/jaffle/syntax/);
- all Strudel examples has been successfully converted to Jaffle;
- extensive [unit tests](tests/transpiler.test.ts)

## Roadmap

I plan to create a visual interface for Jaffle.

The whole point of this project is not actually to define a tune in Yaml, it's to define a tune in structured data. Since this part is now done, I would like to work on an alternative Yaml editor with a visual interface, in order to make this process even more user-friendly. This one could be made of boxes linked with wires (such as in [jsonvis](https://zuramai.github.io/jsonvis/) but more compact).

Additional planned features:

- better syntax highlighting;
- code completion;
- own documentation.

## Syntax

Go to the [syntax section](https://roipoussiere.frama.io/jaffle/syntax) in the Jaffle website (or alternatively read [its source](./website/content/syntax.md) if necessary).
