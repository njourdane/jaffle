## Introduction

Jaffle is a yaml-based syntax for [Tidal-cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), based on [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org).

It aims to make algorithmic music more accessible for people who are not familiar with programming languages.

Under the hood, Jaffle is a transpiler generating JavaScript code, which is then interpreted by Strudel.

## Syntax

Go to the [syntax section](https://roipoussiere.frama.io/jaffle/syntax) in the Jaffle website (or alternatively read [its source](./website/content/syntax.md) if necessary).
