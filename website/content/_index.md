# Jaffle

An hybrid yaml/node editor for [Tidal-cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), based on [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org).
{.subtitle}

Jaffle aims to make algorithmic music more accessible for people who are not familiar with programming languages.
{.description}

You can discover the syntax by looking at some examples using the menu (translated from the [Strudel examples](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/examples/)), or take a look at the [syntax page](/syntax) for more details. Then switch to the [full-screen editor](editor/).
