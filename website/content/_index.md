# Jaffle

An hybrid yaml/node editor for [Tidal-cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), based on [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org).
{.subtitle}

Jaffle aims to make algorithmic music more accessible for people who are not familiar with programming languages.
{.description}

You can start to discover some tunes below (translated from the [Strudel examples](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/examples/)), then take a look at the [syntax page](/syntax) for more details and play with the [larger editor](editor/).

The node editor is not editable and only acts as tune visualization for now. Soon it will be possible to switch between yaml and node editor.
